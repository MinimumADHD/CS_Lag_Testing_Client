# whats this?
- honestly, made that just because I needed some way to test and eventually patch lag && || client related issues in games.
usage of ChatGPT was included in **the code**.

# someone is using that to lag switch inside your game?
- your own issue


ADDENDUM:
shall you want to download the .exe for development or other "that-is-legit" operations, resort to the at least the [v1.0.2 release+](https://github.com/MinimumADHD/CS_Lag_Testing_Client/releases/tag/v1.0.2).
this repo won't be maintained further as the software accomplishes what it's meant to do, unless i'll ever need to accomplish changes for future needs or by dev-related issues. (or even SDK changes)
